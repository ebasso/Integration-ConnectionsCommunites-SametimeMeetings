# Description

This routine syncronizes IBM Connections Communities and IBM Sametime Meetings Rooms, i. e., for each community created in IBM Connections,
a meeting room is created in Sametime Meetings.

After creating the Meeting Room, a important bookmark is on Community in Connections. So a link will be show on Overview page of Community.

If user is an Owner is a Community, he will a proprietary on the Meeting Rooms.
